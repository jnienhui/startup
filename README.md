Hello my name is Jacob Nienhuis a current sophomore at BYU majoring in computer science with a software engineering emphasis.
One of the few hobbies that I enjoy is reading books. Specifically fiction books. However, I've noticed as time passes that this hobby is not as popular anymore.
Some may say this is due to the increased usage and popularity of computers and other devices, but I instead believe it is due to the lack of recommendations.
Thus I will be creadting a website with my own book recommendations that come with my own reviews of them along with where to get them which I hope you will check out.

![Home Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100976795/215240395-e2aeea84-c5f0-4292-b93e-d1c9eae6d283.jpg)


![Recommendation page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100976795/215240418-43d608db-efef-4803-83be-8768df017c64.jpg)

Key Features:

- Visitors can leave their own recommendations

- Visitors can rate the recommendation on a scale 1-5 and average will be taken

- Visitors should only be able to submit 1 rating per a work (can edit rating later)

- Login to track ratings and unique recommendations

- Average ratings will be displayed in real time

- Visitors can read all the recommendations split into 3 categories(Manga, Books, Lightnovels)

- Ratings can be reset by admin if needed


Notes (Simon CSS)

- The bootstrap allows for a significantly easier time in styling and coloring components on the website
- css also allows for the moving and positioning of objects better
- should code html and css at the same time to make it easier to see the changes made and how to position

Notes (Simon javascript)

- can use similar code to simon's play javascript file to write functions for buttons.
- have something similar to scores javascript to keep track of people's book reviews.

Notes (Startup HTML/CSS Deliverable)
- the form element is very useful in creating places for the user to input information
- for my Recommendations use IDs to separate the star rating's to make data easier to collect from them.

Notes (Startup javascript Deliverable)
- The use of JSON stringify and parse is quite large and can be used for booleans, arrays and other things
- the rating system's javascript is complete but not working completely as I intended yet as I will use databases later to store objects so that a rating is unique to each user
- in other words the rating won't add a new one to the array everytime a star is clicked instead it will update the rating in the user object and than update the overall.
